# Enigma Corp
Enigma Corp is an ever expanding mod that centers around the story of the Enigma Corporation, a new and mysterious weapons developer that has only risen up since shortly before the player begins their journey. 

# NOTICE:
The plugin is currently in a transition state. Don't install the current branch and instead use one of the releases, as right now a lot of the stuff has been taken out for reorganizing and using the current set up could break old games with the plugin and won't add anything for new games.
