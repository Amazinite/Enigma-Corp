# Enigma Corp
Enigma Corp is an ever expanding mod that centers around the story of the Enigma Corporation, a new and mysterious weapons developer that has only risen up since shortly before the player begins their journey. 
The mod also adds two other human factions, the Freelancers and the Outer Rim Mining company, each with their own planned content.
But it's not only human's you'll find. There are rumors told by the Quarg of an ancient race of aliens imprisoned by the Drak for their terrible deeds, doing far worse things than the Korath had supposedly done. Will you find these aliens? And if you do, how will your interactions with them change the face of the Milky Way?

Enjoy playing with dozens of new outfits and multiple new ships, as well as exploring the over 40 new systems that this mod adds. Where will your travels take you? Find out today!
