	description "Some random dude in a tuxedo came here one day and just dropped these off. He says that they're some sort of prototype for something he's working on, and that he wants us to test them out for him. Not that I'm complaining, they keep the Republic out of my cargo. -Pirate Shopkeeper."

	description "Behold! A smugglers best friend! This reflective plating works* by reflecting** any incoming scans, so if those pesky Republic ships try and scan your illegal cargo, they'll end up scanning themselves! Isn't that great?"
	description "*These will only work if your entire ship is covered in this plating, so make sure to save some space."
	description "**Enigma Corp is not liable for any ships that are scanned while using reflective plating, as traveling thourgh space may scratch the plating and reduce its effectivness."

	description "Exotic matter is similar to antimatter, but instead of having the opposite charge of normal matter, it has opposite mass. This means that exotic matter has negative mass, making it possible to reduce the total mass of a ship. Helpful for freighters that travel through areas of high piracy."
