	description "For when you’re in the heat of battle and need some extra energy, say hello to the Fuel Powered Generator. Fire this thing up in the middle of battle to convert your hyperspace fuel into useable energy. Especially useful for those with a lot of fuel but not much space for batteries or reactors."
	description "Due to the massive amounts of heat generated when in use, the generator requires the use of one of your ship's gun ports to be used as an exhaust port to let out all the heat."
