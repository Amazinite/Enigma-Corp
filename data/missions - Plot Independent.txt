			`	Some of the other guys in the party also turn their heads and shout:`

			`	"Wazzuuuuuuup?" you shout back in reply.`
			`	One of the more sober looking individuals walks up to you and introduces himself.`

			`You spend what feels like hours partying. Drinking beer, messing around, and watching the Quasars versus the Greyhounds on the bar's video screen.`
			`	You feel terribly drunk. How many drinks has it been? Six? Seven? Whatever it's been, you're clearly in no state of mind to be making big decisions.`
			`	A few of the guys over in the corner are making up stupid dare, flipping a coin, and seeing who has to do them. One of them calls for you.` 
			`	"Hey <first>! Want to play?"`
			`	You hobble over to the corner and sit down in an empty chair, ready to make up the stupidest dare of your life. For some reason, the only thing you can think about is the Sidewinder Missile Launcher.`
			`	"Loser has to go to Lovelace Labs and spray paint something on the side of a building."`
			`	The table goes crazy, ready to see who has to go out to <destination> and vandilize Lovelace Labs.`
			choice
				`	"I choose heads."`
					goto heads
				`	"I choose tails."`

			`	The coin flips in to the air, flying one end over the other. It flips for what feels like forever, before finally fallng to the table. It bounces once. Twice. Three times. Finally, it lands on the table. You lean in to see what it is.`
			`	Heads. You lose.`

Still drunk, you get up from your chair and hobble over to your ship, being cheered as you go. Some of the other guys from the party hop into their ships, poised on following you to <destination> to see it happen in person.`
