			`Walking up to the spaceport's bar, you notice that the entire station is rather empty compared to most other places you've been to. There couldn't be more than two dozen people in sight, most of them appearing to be uniformed workers, despite the area being massive. The Enigma Corporation must have not done a good job of advertising their grand openning.`
			`	While taking a sip of the drink that you ordered (which tastes pretty stale, and really isn't worth the credits you spent for it) a shady looking character sits down next to you and orders a drink.

The only problem is that they've banned me from setting foot on their sites, bioscanners and shit stopping me from even getting near their planets without setting off alarms, so I need someone else to help me out."`
