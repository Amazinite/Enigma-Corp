	description `Nicknamed "Frozen Hell" by some of the workers at Outer Rim Mining, Hierro is a strange place. It orbits rather close to a gas giant, causing high amounts of volcanic activity. Even so, the orbit of the moon means that it is only within the habitable zone of the star for half of it's orbit, so for a few weeks it is reasonably livable, but the next few weeks are extrememly cold.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located inside of a volcano. The only way you were able to find it was because of the large beacon shooting out of the middle of the crater. You question whether or not having the entire spaceport inside a volcano to harness geothermal power is worth the danger of having the volcano erupt on to the space port.`

	description `Diamond Station is the refueling station for Outer Rim Mining ships. Ship land to refuel every time the get ready to leave and when they reenter inhabited space.`
	spaceport `As with The Hub, almost all landing pads are taken by freighters entering and exiting the spaceport. Given the size of the station, there are a lot less landing pads, so you wonder how they keep up with all the ships without clogging up traffic. Just then, a floating drone flies over to your ship and refuels it before you even land, then flies off to refuel more ships.`
