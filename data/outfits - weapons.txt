	description "This modified meteor missile launcher was recently developed by Enigma Corp. All saftey measures were removed, allowing for more missile capacity, faster firing, and virtually no energy consumption. This comes at the cost of a slightly larger size and much more heat generation when fired."

	description "The Missile Turret is the next step in missile technology developed by Lovelace Labs. It was becoming increasingly difficult to design missiles with better homing and turning capabilities, so a scientist at Lovelace proposed that a missile turret be developed. This would lower a ship's need to get in position to fire missiles and make it much easier to hit moving targets, as the missiles will already be flying directly towards their target instead of needing to make u-turns and end up running out of fuel."
	description "The design team decided to simply take a Sidewinder Missile Launcher and place it on a rotating platform. Because of this, the missile turret takes the same ammo as Sidewinder Missile Launchers."

	description "The Forge Cannon is a highly powerful rail gun that fires titanium slugs at extreme speeds. The kinetic force of this weapon hitting something causes a massive explosion, quickly ripping through any hull that it hits, while also doing large amounts of shield damage. Due to the size of the slugs and the amount of damage that could be caused by a malfunction, slugs are slowly and carefully reloaded into the cannon, leading to rather long reload times."

	description "The Grav Bomb has the reverse effect of the Gravitational Wave Generator, pulling ships toward the origin point as opposed to pushing them away. This can be extremely helpful for pulling smaller and quicker ships into your optimal weapon ranges, or just stopping those pesky Navy Rainmakers from getting too far away."
