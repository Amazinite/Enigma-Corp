	description "The Slug Cannon is a highly powerful railgun that fires titanium slugs at extreme speeds, able to reach very long ranges. The kinetic force of the slug landing on a target causes a massive explosion, dealing large amounts of damage and knocking back the ship that it hits. Due to the size of the slugs and the power at which the projectile is launched, they are slowly loaded into the barrel of the weapon and time must be taken for the cannon to charge, leading to rather long reload periods."

	description "After the huge success of the Hellfire Missile Launcher, the Corporation decided to attempt the same thing with Lovelace's Sidewinder Missile Launcher. As a result, the Flux Missile Launcher was born. Given a similar makeover as the Hellfire Missile Launcher, the Flux Missile Launcher fires faster and holds more missiles, while also having better homing and velocity."

	description "The Hellfire Missile Launcher was the first in a long line of patent-infringing weapons that were developed by the Enigma Corporation. Using the Meteor Missile Launcher as a base, all safety measures were removed. This allows for a faster fire rate and next to no energy consumption at the cost of greatly increased heat generated per shot. They also added a larger missile storage compartement, which increases the amount of space needed to fit the launcher."

	description "To avoid complete legal suicide, the Corporation decided to change the design of the Meteor Missile to make it a different missile entirely. The Hellfire Missile has a higher velocity, better homing capabilities, and a higher explosive yeild compared to its Meteor Missile cousin, but at the cost of lasting a much shorter amount of time and doing far less shield damage."

This allows for considerable amounts of damage to be dealt up close, but makes the weapon almost completely useless at range.`

	description "Although some at the Syndicate saw the Proton Gun's inability to produce a coherent beam a fatal flaw in its design, others saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a small yet powerful anti-capital ship weapon. By increasing the total amount of current that is run through the coils of the gun, a more powerful beam is produced. This however causes the beam to be even more incoherent, reducing its accuracy and range, but also increasing its total potential damage."
	description "The first iteration of the weapon was found to be rather useless on larger ships as they had trouble getting close enough to use the weapon, so the Syndicate decided to scale the weapon done and market it as a fighter or interceptor weapon instead."

This would allow missiles to be fired directly at their target, removing the need for missiles to make wide turns and waste much of their fuel and artificially increasing their targeting capabilities."
