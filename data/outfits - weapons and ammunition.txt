With enough explosive yield to level half a star system, the Antimatter Launcher requires a specially fitted capital ship to even fit and fire."

The Shrapnel Cannon is just that. The large shrapnel shells fired from this weapon explode upon reaching the end of the barrel, firing out sixteen super-heated pellets. This allows for considerable amounts of damage to be dealt up close, but makes the weapon almost completely useless at range.`
