The landing pad then retracts back into the station and begins automatically refueling your ship. The entire inside of the station is a chrome looking color, and you are immediately met by an Enigma Corp worker as you step outside of your ship.`

Much of the station is labeled as "authorized personnel only," leaving you with only the outfitters and shipyards to explore. `
	description `	Part of the hangar wall is a large tinted glass window facing the center of the system. You are able to see the binary stars orbiting each other in close proximity, one pulling gas from the other due to its immense gravity.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is full of men and women in light blue suits, most of which are busy unloading the freighters that enter the station and carting off the cargo to another section of the station. At the far end of the hangar you can see what appears to be a shipyard of sorts, with workers building or repairing small ships that you have never seen before, likely a new ship that will eventually be released onto the market.`
