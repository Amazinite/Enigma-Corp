There are tools everywhere and workers are constantly running around, looking like they're barely keeping the place together. No one comes to your aid to refuel your ship, so you have to walk over to the refuel station and refuel your ship on your own.`

planet Hierro
	attributes orm
	landscape land/lava0
	description `Nicknamed "Frozen Hell" by some of the workers at Outer Rim Mining, Hierro is a strange place. It orbits rather close to a gas giant, causing high amounts of volcanic activity. Even so, the orbit of the moon means that it is only within the habitable zone of the star for half of it's orbit, so for a few weeks it is reasonably livable, but the next few weeks are extrememly cold.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located inside of a volcano. The only way you were able to find it was because of the large beacon shooting out of the middle of the crater. You question whether or not having the entire spaceport inside a volcano to harness geothermal power is worth the danger of having the volcano erupt on to the space port.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is blocked off from the rest of the settlement with high walls and laser gates at every doorway. A few men in military looking suits get up from the cafeteria area across the spaceport and refill your ship before going back to eating.`

	description `Indalo appears to be the only planet in the entire region to have plant life on it. There are no factories anywhere, and the only evidence of human civiliation is the small spaceport city located near the equator.`
	spaceport `There appears to be only one landing pad, but when you land you are lowered down into an underground parking complex. You noticed what appears to be hundreds of rows of ships. A tube attatches to the entrance of your ship, which leads to an elevator to the surface of the planet.`

	spaceport `Freighters full of ore are constantly flying in and out of the atmoshphere, taking up most of the landing pads. After about an hour of talking with the command tower and waiting for an opening, you are allowed to land on a landing pad near the edge of the spaceport.`

planet "Foruht Etin"

	description `Foruht Etin is the home world of the Forsaken Ones, or at the very least their most recently established capital. The entire planet appears to be a single gigantic city. From pole to pole and all around the equator, skyscrapers block out any sight of land or sea.`
	description `	A section of city in the northern hemisphere appears different from the rest; buildings are more spread apart and the entire area is surrounded by a wall that dwarfs even the skyscrapers around it. In the center of this section is a large, circular based building that is visible even from orbit. It is likely that this is their main base of operations, the capital of their entire empire.`

planet "Forsorp Maka"
	attributes forsaken manufacturing
	landscape land/loc1
	description `Judging by the large factories that output ships and crates of unknown supplies and the freighters carrying large shipments into orbit, Forsorp Maka is one of the Forsaken Ones' manufacturing worlds, producing all that it needed to run the Forsaken empire. Much of what is produced appears to be warships and weapons, as if the Forsaken were preparing for a large battle, or are even in one.`
	description `	Many of the smaller freighters seem to carry their supplies eastward galacticaly, toward the direction of the capital, but every so often a large freighter carries with it an entire warship or an unbelievably large crate that is presumably full of weapons and hauls it off westward.`

planet "Fuhtwar Qu'ug"
	attributes forsaken abandoned
	landscape land/lava1
	description `Fuhtwar Qu'ug seems to have been abandoned many years ago. The surface is almost entirely covered in craters and the sky is constantly overcast. Any buildings that did survive whatever bombardment occurred here are overgrown with some sort of alien flora. Inside some of the more intact buildings are large alien warships or pieces of weaponry, making this possibly an old military planet.`
	description `	Upon inspecting some of the alien technology closer, you are unable to find any ways to use it. There are no visible inputs or outputs to any of the outfits and the ships do not even appear to have cockpits to them. You can't help but notice that a few of the outfits and ships are very Quarg-like in nature, but it is no guarantee that they are from the Quarg themselves.`

planet "Fuhtwar Sorp"
	attributes forsaken military
	landscape land/loc0
	description `Fuhtwar Sorp is unlike the other Forsaken military planets in that it does not appear to be made for war itself. Many of the complexes, instead of being surrounded by walls, are open and full of ship hangars and storage warehouses. Large vehicles move crates from the shipments brought by freighters into the warehouses, and newly arrived ships are wheeled into the hangars. It is almost as if this planet is meant to be some sort of resupplying center or a secondary base of operations, supporting whatever war may be going on on the front lines.`

planet "Akinagol"
	attributes quarg abandoned
	landscape land/nasa7
	description `Akinagol's surface is a place of nightmares. Scattered across the planet are the empty husks of Quarg warships and what can only be assumed to be Quarg skeletons. Large craters pepper the surface, most three times larger than the craters on the neighboring Forsaken planet, and some being so large that they have pierced the crust of the planet to reveal the mantle below. The atmosphere is poisonous to breathe from the amount of sulfuric gases, and the rains eat away at any organic material unlucky enough not to be under cover. Some small animals and plants have managed to survive whatever hell this planet went through, but they are few and far between with most looking as though they are on Death's doorstep.`

planet "Emuhforp"
	attributes quarg abandoned
	landscape land/sea6
	description `Emuhforp has escaped whatever fate its neighboring system was met with. The surface is not littered with craters or old and forgotten warships, and the local life seems to be thriving rather well. From time to time while scanning the surface you are able to spot through the plant growth what look like buildings that are made out of the same material used in Quarg ships, suggesting that the Quarg once inhabited this planet. Despite this, no Quarg or Quarg ships can be found anywhere. It is likely that the Quarg evacuated this planet before the battle reached it, saving the planet and its native inhabitants.`

planet "Alf Minres"
	attributes quarg station abandoned
	landscape land/station2
	description `Whether this old Quarg ringworld was somehow damaged or just never finished is unclear, but it does seem to have been abandoned for some time now. None of the electronics are working and dust has settled in a thick layer within pressurized areas of the ring.`

planet "Forfut Mun"
	attributes forsaken food
	landscape land/hills5-sfiera
	description `Forfut Mun is undoubtedly a world meant entirely for the production of food. The planet is covered in farms and fields, growing all sorts of alien plants and raising various animals. The only part of the planet that isn't being used to produce food of some sort is the central spaceport, a large area of land comprised of hundreds of landing pads positioned side by side with a refueling station every ten or so landing pads. Food is packaged in crates and placed on freighters before being shipped off to whatever planet requires food at the moment.`

	description `Forfut Nun is some kind of food processing world filled with processing factories and spaceports for haulers. Forsaken freighters carrying crates of all sorts of food are flown in from neighboring farming systems and hauled off by transportation robots into the factories. On the opposite side of the buildings are large warehouses where crates of processed food are stored before being picked up and carried off to population and military planets by freighters.`

planet "Forpup Unu"
	attributes forsaken population
	landscape land/city9
	description `Unlike the rest of the Forsaken worlds, Forpup Unu appears to have no specific purpose. There are no factories, no military complexes, and no overly-extravagant buildings. The planet is mainly cities, but there are a few more suburban looking areas, and unlike the capital where every inch of the surface is covered by buildings, oceans and mountains are visible. The only notable difference on this planet is the size of the buildings; they appear to reach many kilometers in height, some dwarfing even nearby mountains. Each building must be able to hold thousands of people at the very least, making it not all that unlikely that this planet has a higher population than even the capital.`
	spaceport `The Forpup Unu spaceport seems relatively normal compared to other Forsaken space ports, aside from one fact; almost all of the Forsaken appear to be wearing some sort of breathing apparatus or gas mask. Outside of the spaceport off in the distance can be seen a large construct being build. It looks as though it is a wall similar to those on Forsaken military planets, but whatever it is being made out of is clear.`

	description `Forfut Tun is another one of the Forsaken food planets, entirely converted into farms and fields. It would be hard to tell the difference between this world and other Forsaken food production worlds were it not for the highly visible domes surrounding many of the fields and farms. The purpose for the domes is not made clear by simply looking at them, possibly they are used as a biosphere of sorts to increase food production, but not all of the fields have them. In some areas of the planet, Forsaken are hastily building more domes and carrying building materials to the construction sites.`

	description `Fuhtwar Pu'ug is an entirely militarized planet, covered in sectors of shipyards and hangars all surrounded by high walls topped with turrets. Despite all the work put into militarizing the entire planet, it has been completely abandoned. The atmosphere is extremely thin, but suggesting from the rest of the planets that the Forsaken inhabit, it was once much thicker. The strange radiation that is detectable in orbit is still present on the surface of the planets albeit at a lower amount.`
	description `	Of the many military complexes across the planet, some of them seem to be in serious disrepair, crumbling away at the way and, despite being made out of some sort of alloy or concrete, looking as thought they are rotting.`

planet "Forec Rut'ic"
	attributes forsaken abandoned
	landscape land/bwerner2
	description `Although Forec Rut'ic appears to have once been inhabited by a large number of species, it is currently completely barren. There is no longer an atmosphere on the planet, leading to the eternally black sky above the surface. Around where you landed are a number of scattered bones from long dead animals (some of which seem to be decaying away somehow) and you notice on your ship scanner that the radiation levels are dangerously high; higher than anywhere else in this section of space. Out in the distance is the skyline of a vast advanced looking city that appears to be surrounded in a dome of sorts, but to take time explore it would likely be death due to the radiation.`

planet "Forsorp Rud"
	attributes forsaken abandoned
	landscape land/canyon2
	description `Forsorp Rud shares the same fate as that of the planet in the neighboring system; radiation has stripped the atmosphere clean off the planet, leading to the demise of the many species that once lived and thrived here. The surface seems scorched from the radiation and there are no signs of any life. The only sign of any past life on this planet is a number of abandoned cities, many of which are full of factory-looking buildings that have multiple smoke stacks protruding from the top floors, but even these seem to be rotting away and crumbling like the rest of the planet.`
