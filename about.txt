	*Space Junk!
		*Space junk is a system that allows you to find abandoned ships floating around in space to earn money and the chance of a free ship. There are two types:
		**Minables: Using the minable asteroids system, find small ships floating around in uninhabited systems that, when destroyed, drop damaged outfits and scrap metal to sell.
		**Spawnables: Abandoned ships that can be found floating around in space. The ships have different rarities of what you will find and spawn anywhere from 3 to 6 systems from where you last landed.
		*Space junk also has two different types of outfits that you can find (aside from the normal outfit variants).
		**Damaged outfits: completely useless outfits that are meant for nothing more than selling for cash.
		**Salvaged outfits: outfits that are less valuable than normal outfits, as well as still being installable, but at the cost of worse stats than their normal versions.
	*Compatible with Wrzlprnft's World Forge super sandbox mod!
		
	Disclaimer: the following content is all work in progress:
	*A whole new GALAXY to explore, the Andromeda galaxy, filled with its own unqiue inhabitants and story!
	*Three ALIEN governments to explore!
		*The Andromedans: The main inhabitants of the Andromeda Galaxy, a cruel authoritarian race who seeks for nothing more than to spread.
		*The Termini: Not much is known about the Termini, only that they appeared after the end of the Pug invasion. They are a rare sight, but are always seen within the systems that the Pug once occupied, doing who knows what.
		*The ???: A newly discovered race located just outside of the space of the Outer Rim that ORM has occupied. Trapped inside of a small part of the galaxy for thousands of years by the Drak, the ??? are simply waiting for another being to come along with a Jump Drive to allow them to escape their enclosure.
