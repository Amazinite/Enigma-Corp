V0.5.4 and a half
  Content
    Replaced the Decoy Engines with X1025 Ion Engines.
    Termini Drones are now automaton and uncaptureable.
    There is now a station in the Enigma system called "Enigma Meridian" that holds within it stuff that is purposefully OP and unbalanced as well as some ships that you aren't normally suppose to be able to buy
      This is just for testing purposes. Go ahead and mess with the stuff if you want. It will be gone in v0.6.0. :)
    Enigma Corp and ORM no longer fine you when you have illegal outfits and cargo.
    The Sadr-Immeo wormhole now has a path for your pathing ai to use.
    Added new systems located in the Outer Rim to be used in a later update.
    Updated the navy license mission for v0.9.2 compatability. You must start the mission line within 60 days of completing the main plot and finish it within 90 days of completing the main plot.
    Reworked the "New Syn Tech" mission to require you to return some cargo that is found on the NPC to the Syndicate instead of just boarding it.
      Declining this mission makes the core pirates stronger.
      Declining this mission also triggers the event, which would normally be triggered upon completion, after 60 days.
    Reworked the "New FW Tech" mission to where the merchants will explain to you that they have Jump Drives on their Bulk Freighters.
      Declining this mission also triggers the event, which would normally be triggered upon completion, after 60 days.
    Reworked Enigma Corp 1C so that you can actually make the Dire Hawks cloak.
    Reworked many of the descriptions for ships and outfits.
    Capacity upgraders are now abbreviated as "Cap-Up" instead of "Cap. Up."
    Capacity Upgraders are now categorized as "Ammunition" instead of "Systems."
    Removed old Echo 7 images and the Legacy Echo images.
  Balance
    Plasmathrower now also does some heat damage.
    Ammunition has been given mass and weapons that require ammo have had their mass reduced.
    Antimatter Bombs and Crew Implants are now illegal. Like really illegal. Like "I'll kill you for possessing one of these" illegal. Like 50 years in jail for possessing 2 grams of weed in America type of illegal.
    The Shrapnel Cannon now has a random velocity and random lifetime to it so that the pellet spread is not the same every time.
      Pellets do more damage (62.5 -> 75), but have less hit force (100 -> 50).
    The Rocket Launcher has had its attack and defense reduced to be equal to that of two frag grenades.
    As a result of the Rocket Launcher change, Incendiary Grenades have had their attack and defense both buffed.
  Bug Fixes
    The usual typo fixes (thx @Alkallid and Takarada)
    Fixed the Echo 50 engine coordinates.
    Fixed the Echo 99 gun port coordinates.
    Better Andromeda galaxy image.
    Fixed a bug that caused a random system with nothing in it to appear at position 0,0.
    The Star King and Star Guardian are now sold with the proper amount of Flux Missiles.

V0.5.4 Missions and Compatibility
  New missions
    Introductory missions for the Andromedans and Termini that hint as to the direction of both storylines.
    Mission line that involves you assisting in rebuilding the Geminus shipyard that was destroyed before the war. Gain access to purchase your very own Navy ships, including the Carrier and Cruiser!
    Mission with the Enigma Corp to unlock new technologies for your use and their profit. Earn the right to purchase new and improved versions of Enigma Corp ships.
  New ships
    EC-001 ‘Badger’ drone. Developed by Enigma Corp as a competitor to the Republic Navy’s Combat Drone. Bigger, better, and more expensive.
    EC-070 ‘Star Guardian,’ an even better version of the Star King, the Star Guardian was developed to protect the most important of individuals on their travels through space. It is also fit with a special EMP device that shocks the electrical systems of all nearby enemy ships, allowing the Star Guardian to escape with no problems.
    EC-078 ‘Dire Hawk,’ a stealth version of the ‘Dire Wolf’ that has a built in experimental cloaking device and even more space for weapons.
  New weapons unlocked through missions
    Seeker Laser, a strange weapon that fires a beam of protons that track targets.
    Missile Denial System, a highly energy taxing weapon that demolishes any missiles that enter its range.
    Cryo Beam, freeze your target’s ship into submission, leaving them completely helpless as you destroy them.
  New Images
    Almost all the ships that have been added are getting a blender makeover from Wrzlprnft.
  New Sounds
    Shrapnel Cannon (not working)
    RE Skylance
  Changes, Tweaks, and Misc Additions.
    Enigma Stations have governments to them.
    Removing the Echo 7s due to the addition of Southern Carriers in v0.9.0.
    Reducing the damage of all non-missile weapons by 33% to coincide with the nerf that all non-missile weapons are getting in the vanilla game in v0.9.0
    I’ve reformatted some of the mission files to help organize. 
    The Syndicate Technology mission now requires you to board the target instead of blowing it up. 
    Fixed some spelling and grammar errors in the mission where you meet the Enigma Corp CEO. Thanks Toilethinges. 
    I’ve connected the Enigma system to a different system. This is because Laconda (or something like that), a system from Shields Up, was also attached to Wezen and would sever the link with Enigma depending on which plugin was loaded by the game first. 
    Korath Destroyer
      Removing it due to it being completely useless thanks to me making reverse engineered jump drives purchasable. 
      On a similar note, the RE jump drive now has slightly weaker stats than the normal jump drive (0.9 jump drive from 1, 0.25 jump speed from 0.3)
    A rare Drak Archon will sometimes appear watching over Enigma Prime
    There are now Enigma Corp merchant fleets that can sometimes be seen around Syndicate space and near Enigma stations.

  Real quick compatibility fix with Shields Up; there were two systems with the same name.

V0.5.3 Descriptions, Spaceports, and Some Other Stuff
  Outfits with no descriptions now have descriptions
  All 5 Enigma Stations in human space now have descriptions for the station and the spaceport.
  I’ve added some labels to the map, because why not. They totally look like they’re part of the vanilla game.
  Reworked the explosions of the new ships to be more like their categories.
  Changes and Tweaks
    Reduced the hull penalty of the external fuel pod from 100 to 99 in order to avoid a bug that I found.
    The Enigma Corp government is now colored green instead of black.
    Enigma Prime now has both Deep Sky Basics and Advanced outfitters, as well as Enigma Epsilon
    The Repair Laser projectile has been changed to new “slow laser” technology, and has gotten a 50% hull repair rate buff (300 to 450).
    In response to recent events, I’m nerfing all hand to hand weapons. They will all have slightly lower attack (0.1 to 0.5 less, depending on the item) while also increasing the cost.

V0.5.2 Weapon and Systems Balancing
  Added a Grav Bomb, the reverse of the Gravitational Wave Generator
  There’s also a Warp Inhibitor in the weapons.txt that I haven’t implemented yet. Check it out if you want.

V0.5.1a Hotfix
  Resized the Aegis and Rattlesnake images to better fit their roles 
  The Rattlesnake was way too big for a medium warship and the Aegis felt too small
  You’ll need to rebuy your Aegis and Rattlesnakes to fix any offset engines and weapon hardpoints.
  Fixed some of the capacity upgrades to work now
  Flux Missile cap. up.
  Thermite torpedo cap. up.
  Flux torpedo cap. up.

V0.5.1- Ship Balancing
  Balance out every ship in some way, shape, or form. Not going to post it all because it would take up like two entire pages and be pretty pointless.
  Gave the ships some new descriptions.
  The Orca now explodes when it dies

  Orca description now says 6 turrets instead of 12
  Fuel Powered Generator is now listed under power

V0.5.0- Alien Invasion! (not really though [kind of])
  2 new alien factions!
    The Andromedans: a newly discovered wormhole is leading pilots to the Andromeda Galaxy, somewhere where no one has been before. Upon arrival, pilots have occasionally had run-ins with an unknown alien race that have been dubbed Andromedans. They are hostile to anything that is not their own, and are immensely powerful.
      Upon further investigation, it has been found that the Andromedans are somewhat of a primitive species when it come to their technology. They have never discovered anything more powerful than combustion engines or ballistic weaponry, and do not even posses shield technology. Because of this, the only way that their civilization has been able to advance is to make their ships and weapons even bigger. Andromedan ships have massive hulls and extremely powerful weapons, but they have very little range and are rather slow due to their technology and size.
      Given the massive need for raw materials and energy in order to sustain the Andromedan society, any planet that is deemed uninhabitable is immediately marked off for being mined away. The sheer amount of raw materials received from mining away entire solar systems is only barely enough to feed their massive empire. Stars too are sucked up of every possible drop of energy, having gigantic Dyson Sphere around many stars, with most still seemingly under construction or left to remain in their unfinished state.
      It is unconfirmed whether or not Andromedans possess faster than flight travel, as no one has ever witnessed one of their ships entering or exitting a system through any warp or hyper drive system currently known, and they seem to salvage any hyperdrives and warp drives that they find as they prey upon hopeless explorers. As such, it has been speculated that Andromedan lives last many millennium if they are able to hold together such a massive galactic empire without faster than light travel. 
      Lately, Andromedan ships have been rarely seen entering the Milky Way through the same wormhole that explorers are entering Andromeda through. They appear for just a short while before returning back through the wormhole, but this alone is unsettling to some and seems to indicate that the Andromedans are preparing to enter the Milky Way with a strong force.

    The Termini: little is known about the Termini, as they have only been recently sighted flying around human space, starting shortly after the end of the Pug War. Some claim to have seen Termini scout ships, which is only what we can assume they are, flying out of the wormhole that was left behind by the Pug. None of the other alien races that we are able to contact have any information on the Termini. One can only hope that they are here for peace and not war. 
      Both alien species ship sprites courtesy of Millionth Vector’s blog.

  Story Changes
    I’ve removed the conversation you have at Enigma Prime for the time being. Will be reintroduced in the story update of v0.6.0.
    There are now 5 Enigma Corp stations located throughout human space that unlock new technology through the story campaign.
    Enigma Prime is now only unlockable after the main story has been completed. Head towards your nearest friendly neighborhood pirate planet and hang out around the spaceport.
    Two missions that unlock new technology after the main campaign has been finished. Ask around the Deep and Syndicate space for two separate missions. 

  9 new ships (and a drone)!
    EC-007 Carrier and EC-007 Civilian Class Carrier, for those who want a carrier of their own without needing to steal some navy license or attack navy ships.
    EC-031 ‘Viper,’ EC-032 ‘Rattlesnake,’ and EC-033 ‘King Cobra.’ Three missile warships in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy in that order. Fitted with more gun hardpoints than most ships of the same size and above average shields, but lower armor.
    EC-037 ‘Aegis,’ a medium and heavy warship mix. It’s the size of a medium warship but has the weapon capacity of a heavy warship, making it an interesting ship to fly.
    EC-050 ‘Orca,’ the newest in freighting technology, having more cargo space than any ship to ever come before it. 
    EC-069 ‘Star King,’ the best of the best when it comes to luxury.
    EC-077 ‘Dire Wolf,’ a stealth bomber fitted with exclusive torpedo launchers that can out damage any other torpedo launcher currently on the market.
    Sentry Drone, a heavy, nearly immobile drone that can be fitted with any turret currently available on the market.

  More new outfits than ever before!
    Hand to Hand
      Breaching Shotgun, an interesting new take on boarding weaponry
      Rocket Launcher, more effective than a grenade thanks to its increased range
      Portable Flamethrower, a highly illegal weapon used only by the most ruthless of individuals
    Guns
      Plasmathrower, a version of the Flamethrower that does ion damage.
      Flux Missiles, Sidewinder missiles modified with a flux explosive that causes a decent amount of shield damage and some ion damage.
      Thermite and Flux Torpedo Launchers, launcher versions of the thermite and flux mine placers
      Shrapnel Cannon, a huge space shotgun.
      Arc Discharger, channel the energy of your ship directly into a weapon, ionizing the shields of your opponents.
      Fuel Rod Launcher, have any extra fuel? Fire it at your enemies!
    Turrets
      Reverse Engineered Skylance, as simple as it sounds. A version of the skylance that isn’t as powerful or efficient, but heck, what else are you going to use?
      Forge Cannon, a long range artillery weapon that does massive damage upon impact but takes a long time to reload.
      Energy Transfer, as a flagship, you can transfer unneeded energy to your escorts if they need it.
    Power and Cooling
      Heavy Water Coolant System, a more effective water cooling system that takes up the same amount of space
      Atomic Batteries, 50% more energy capacity at 200% the cost.
      Blackhole Reactor, Red Star Core, and Cold Fusion Reactor, just a ton of new energy generating systems.
      Fuel Powered Generator, convert your unused hyperspace fuel into energy if you need a little boost in the middle of combat, but beware the massive heat generated from the process.
  Bug fixes, balance changes, and other small stuff
    Most of the double spacing in the code that was caused by me using normal Notepad has been removed. If there’s any files with a lot of extra spacing, go ahead and point them out to me. 
    Balanced out the Antimatter Bomb a "bit" for the arrival of the Drak
      Reduced blast and trigger radius (250 to 100 and 125 to 75 respectively)

      Increased the velocity of the bomb (15 to 25)
      Increased outfit space (55 to 75)
      Acceleration is now positive (0.9 to 1.1)
    Mine Changes
      All mine related images are flipped to differentiate between the torpedoes
      Increased cost of all mine launchers (250k to 500k)
      Explosive/Typhoon Mine Changes
        Renamed to “Typhoon Mine”
        Reduced damage (2000 to 1500)
      Ion/Flux Mine Changes
        Renamed "Flux Mine"
        Reduced ion damage (5000 to 500)

        The image for the Flux Mine is now a darker blue instead of a teal color
      Thermite Mine
        Increased heat damage (2500 to 3000)
        Reduced blast and trigger radius (125 to 85 and 100 to 75 respectively)

    Reflective Plating
      Doubled scan interference (250 to 500)
      Increased mass and outfit space (50 to 60)
    Exotic matter plating mass increased (-50 to -10)
    Enigma Corp Changes
      Renamed the main “Enigma Station” to “Enigma Prime,” just to differentiate between Enigma Corp stations. o3o
      Enigma Prime is now image station7 instead of station1
      Linked Enigma and Wezen
      Removed some things from Enigma Stations that aren’t technically made by Enigma Corp.
      Enigma Corp is now black on the map
      Enigma Prime no longer requires a bribe to enter (if it still requires a bribe, go shoot some pirates or aliens).
    Antimatter Engines
      Changed the effect of Antimatter engines. They’re a pretty purple now.
      Antimatter engines have their own images now
    H2H balance
      Rail Rifle cost increase (20k to 30k)
      Incendiary Grenade cost decrease (100k to 85k)

    Replaced the scram jump drive with the reverse engineered jump drive
    Removed Z class hull plating and overchargers.
    Shortened the name of all capacity upgraders to cap. ups. so that the names do not run into each other in the outfitter menu.
    The Missile Turret is now an invention of Lovelace Labs, along with a changed description.

v0.4.2- More balancing and changes
  Antimatter Bomb and Hellfire Launcher have new images
  Reduced the Hellfire Launcher range (3750 to 3000)
  Hellfire Launcher now has its own icon and projectile instead of the meteor’s
  Renamed the weapon and engine expanders to weapon and engine expansions, to keep it in line with “mass expansion” and “cargo expansion”
  Removed the Anti-Drone Turret and replaced it with a Smart Bomb.
  The Smart Bomb is a proximity explosion that damages ships within a radius around the main ship. Strong enough to take down drones in one hit (if they’re close enough) but has a long reload and high energy requirement.
  Put some stuff in the files for later on. Check it out if you want.

v0.4.1- Balancing Patch
  Cost changes:
    Increased the cost of nanites (100 to 250)
    Increased the cost of Hellfire missiles (750 to 900)
    Reduced the cost of the Missile Turret (150k to 75k)
    Reduced the cost of the Reflective Plating (500m to 100m)

    Reduced the mass of the antimatter thruster and steering (now exactly 20+ outfit space compared to that of the best atomic engines)
    Changed the weapon and engine expanders to match the stats of the mass expansion (now 20 cargo space for 15 weapon or engine space)
    Increased the space of the antimatter launcher (50 to 55)

v0.4- The Adventure Begins
  New Enigma Station description and a first contact mission with Enigma Corp, which replaces the old station description.
  New conversation when you first visit the Enigma Station spaceport that introduces the first story arc of this mod. :)
  Weapon Capacity Upgrades! Increase the total amount of secondary ammo you can carry for a specific weapon.
  Thermite mines! Mines that do a small amount of damage but a large amount of heat damage, causing most ships to overheat.
  Gravitational Wave Generator! Harness the power of two black holes colliding in order to produce a gravitational wave strong enough to push your enemies away. Also helpful for pushing away disabled ships that you want to save for later. 
  Repair Turret! Fire this special turret at any ship you want (preferably friendly) to quickly repair their hull to full. Also helpful for getting allied ships back into the action without needing to board them under fire.
  Some bug fixes and balance changes
    The Ion Mine placer doesn’t hold infinite mines anymore (not exactly sure if that’s something I accidentally made happen while going through the code or not, but I’ll just say it anyways).
    Mines from the mine placer will now stay still. They will eject out the back of your ship then grind to a hult, making them useful for when you’re getting chased.
    The Ion Mine is now in the images, so you should be able to see it without needing Pompano’s mod.
    Doubled the damage of explosive mines
    Hull and Shield upgrades cost a lot less
    Moved the Ion Mine Placers from Syndicate to Deep Sky; Syndicate will own the thermite mines.
    Balanced out the Scram Jump Drive stats (didn’t exactly mean to add it in the previous update so it wasn’t balanced at all).
    Doubled the turn radius of the hellfire missiles to compensate for the lack of range now
    I also moved the data files around to make them more organized and easier to look through.

v0.3 - Images!!!
  I’ve put new images on almost all the things that I’ve added so far! Hope you enjoy! Just don’t look too close and they’ll be good. :)
  Resized the pocket wormhole image to not eat up half the images beside it.
  Fixed some more grammar and spelling issues. Hopefully I’ve fixed all the issues so far.
  Did some rebalancing of what I’ve added. 
  Antimatter bomb takes even less energy to fire now, but the capacity has been halved
  The Hellfire Missiles no longer have more range than the Meteor Missiles
  Tweaked the proximity detonation ranges on the two mines and changed the descriptions of the mine ammunition to something more… descriptive
  Balanced the cost of a few items
  Buffed the two new defensive hand to hand outfits
  Balanced a few system outfits out, such as halving how much mass reduction the exotic matter plating gives.
  And a few other things that I probably forgot.

v0.2 - Hand to Hand Combat & Improved Customization
  Weapon and Engine Expanders, that sacrifice cargo space for weapon and engine space.
  Incendiary Grenades, stronger than nerve gas and just as illegal.
  Plasma and Rail Rifles, two hand to hand weapons that are upgrades to the normal laser rifle
  Plasma Deflector and Personal Shield Generator, two new defenses for you ship.
  External Fuel Pods, give you as much fuel as a normal fuel pod but are attached to the outside of your ship. Pretty sure that’s a hazard during fights.
  And available only at Enigma Station
  Antimatter thrusters and steering, even better than atomic engines, and yet another thing stolen from the Quarg.
  Exotic Matter Plating, plates made of exotic matter, matter with negative mass. Reduce the mass of your ship for more speed!
  Warp Afterburner, an afterburner so powerful that you’ll reach warps speeds in milliseconds.
  Adjustments/Changes
  Fixed some grammar issues
  Tweaked the stats on some of the weapons to balance them out more

v0.1 - The Introduction
  Created the Enigma Corp, located in the Enigma system.
  The Hellfire Missile Launcher, fires faster than a meteor launcher, but for less damage.
  The Anti-Drone Turret, a turret made specifically for fighting against drones.
  The Missile Turret, as simple as it says.
  The Ion and Explosive Mine Placers, place explosive mine and mines that immobilize enemy ships
  The Korath Destroyer, a rather expensive weapon built specifically for fighting the Korath and farming jump drives... at the cost of 25 million credits a rocket.
  The Antimatter Bomb, a rocket launcher that has enough explosive yield to kill any ship in the vanilla game.
  Reflective Plating, helps keep those pesky Republic ships out of your cargo. 
  Special reinforced plating and shield overchargers, which can increase the total hull or shield of a ship.
  The Galaxy Map, located at any pirate planet with an outfitter. Shows all of human space
  The Pocket Wormhole, gives you a seemingly infinite amount of outfit and cargo space.
